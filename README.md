## What is GUNGNIR?

GUNGNIR is a parallel, intelligence-driven **bug bounty** and **penetration testing** platform that fires all security tools simultaneously, correlates findings into **attack chains**, verifies criticals, and presents prioritized, evidence-backed results.

It is designed for **bug bounty hunters**, **security researchers**, **penetration testers**, and **ethical hackers** who want to maximize their finding rate while minimizing false positives and scan time.

### Why GUNGNIR?

Most security tools run sequentially — one tool after another — producing raw output that you have to manually correlate. GUNGNIR changes this:

| Traditional Tools | GUNGNIR |
|---|---|
| Run one tool at a time | **14+ tools fire in parallel** |
| Raw scanner output dumped | **26 attack chain patterns** auto-correlated |
| Manual false positive filtering | **Rule-based FP filtering** built-in |
| No verification — trust the scanner | **Criticals re-tested** before reporting |
| No history — can't track changes | **SQLite persistence** with diffing |
| Fixed pipeline — can't customize | **YAML pipelines** with conditions |
| Need to install each tool separately | **Pre-compiled binaries** auto-downloaded |
| No web interface | **Password-protected web UI** with real-time progress |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/cyb3rvolt3x-A4lixhaS3ntin3l/gungnir.git
cd gungnir
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Set up authentication (for web UI)
gungnir auth setup

# Start the web dashboard
gungnir serve
# → Web UI at http://localhost:8888

# Or use CLI on a target you are authorized to assess
gungnir hunt example.com --scope brief.txt --json results.json --report report.md
```

Authorized / written-scope targets only. Local Juice Shop lab: [gungnir-lab](https://github.com/cyb3rvolt3x-A4lixhaS3ntin3l/gungnir-lab). New here? Follow the [stranger path](docs/STRANGER_PATH.md) (lab → install → hunt).

## Features

### Parallel Execution Engine
All tools fire in **two parallel waves**:
- **Wave 1 (Discovery, ~30s):** subfinder, amass, assetfinder — all find subdomains simultaneously
- **Wave 2 (Deep Scan, ~2-4min):** httpx, ffuf, nuclei, dalfox, sqlmap, gitleaks, corsy, nmap — all scan in parallel
- **Native modules** (JS analyzer, parameter miner, API discovery) run alongside external tools

### 8 Native Security Modules
No external tools required — pure Python, runs anywhere:

| Module | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **JavaScript Analyzer** | Downloads JS files, extracts API routes, parameters, secrets, source maps |
| **Parameter Miner** | Tests 1000+ parameter names for reflection (XSS), errors (SQLi), response changes (IDOR) |
| **API Discovery** | Finds GraphQL (with introspection), Swagger/OpenAPI, Spring Boot Actuator, REST endpoints |
| **Security Header Analyzer** | Audits HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, cookie security flags |
| **Subdomain Takeover Checker** | Checks 12 cloud services for dangling DNS + NXDOMAIN |
| **HTTP Method Tester** | Tests all 12 methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, PROPFIND, etc. |
| **Backup File Finder** | Checks .git, .svn, .env, .bak, .old, editor files, config files |
| **Redirect Chain Mapper** | Follows redirect chains, tests open redirect with 9 payload types |

### Intelligence Engine

#### 26 Attack Chain Patterns
GUNGNIR doesn't just dump raw tool output. It **correlates findings across tools**:

- SSRF + secret exposure → "SSRF → cloud metadata → credential theft" (90% confidence)
- .git exposed + secret → "Source code → secrets leaked" (95% confidence)
- Open redirect + SSRF → "Redirect → SSRF bypass" (70% confidence)
- XSS + admin endpoint → "XSS → session hijack → account takeover" (80% confidence)
- SQLi + admin panel → "SQLi → auth bypass → admin access" (85% confidence)
- CORS misconfig + auth cookie → "CORS + credentials → cross-origin data theft" (80% confidence)
- GraphQL introspection + API routes → "Full API mapping → injection testing" (80% confidence)
- ...and 19 more patterns

#### 10-Factor Priority Scoring
Each finding scored on **10 separate factors** — not one collapsed "AI score":

1. Severity (critical > high > medium > low)
2. Confidence (multi-source > single source)
3. Verification status (verified > unverified)
4. Endpoint sensitivity (`/admin` > `/about`)
5. Secret type (AWS key > generic string)
6. Technology relevance (old tech > new tech)
7. Exposure level (public > internal)
8. Attack chain membership (part of chain = boosted)
9. Novelty (new since last run = boosted)
10. Exploitability (easy > hard)

Each score is **explainable** — GUNGNIR tells you *why* a finding was prioritized.

#### Finding Lifecycle
9 lifecycle states for tracking findings over time:
`NEW → TRIAGED → REPORTED → ACCEPTED → RESOLVED → REGRESSED → DUPLICATE → REJECTED → OUT_OF_SCOPE`

- **Regression detection:** Previously resolved findings that reappear are flagged
- **False-positive suppression:** Rejected findings don't re-alert on future scans
- **Historical diffing:** "5 new findings since last run" — critical for recurring bug bounty work

### Custom Pipelines
Define your own scan workflow in YAML:

```yaml
name: API Hunter
description: Optimized for API endpoints
target_types: [domain, url]

stages:
  - name: recon
    tools: [subfinder, assetfinder]
    parallel: true
  - name: api-discover
    tools: [api-discoverer, js-analyzer]
    parallel: true
  - name: injection
    tools: [nuclei, sqlmap, dalfox]
    parallel: true
    condition: "endpoints contains '/api/' or api_routes > 0"
```

Features:
- **Stage I/O mapping:** Output from one stage feeds into the next
- **Conditional execution:** Skip stages based on conditions (`tech contains 'wordpress'`)
- **Per-tool configuration:** Custom flags, templates, wordlists per tool
- **Pipeline variables:** `{{target}}` templating
- **Validation + dry-run:** Test pipelines before running
- **5 built-in pipelines:** Default, API Hunter, WordPress, Quick Recon, Subdomain Only

### Custom Tool Registration
Register your own scripts as GUNGNIR tools:

```bash
gungnir tools add my-scanner --binary /path/to/script --category vuln_scan --parser json
```

### Session Manager
Capture authenticated sessions and replay them across all tools:
- POST to login URL, capture Set-Cookie headers
- Store auth context (cookies + headers)
- Replay across all subsequent tool requests
- Cookie values masked in logs (security)
- Session file stored with 0o600 permissions

### Tool Conflict Resolution
GUNGNIR **never breaks your existing tools**:

1. Check user-configured override path
2. Check GUNGNIR's own bin directory (`~/.gungnir/bin/`)
3. Check system PATH (your existing install)
4. Download to `~/.gungnir/bin/` only (NEVER to system paths)

### Web UI with Authentication
- **Password-protected** dashboard (bcrypt hashing)
- Session cookies + API keys
- Real-time scan progress via WebSocket
- 7 views: Dashboard, Hunt, Findings, Pipelines, Tools, History, Settings
- Create/edit custom pipelines
- Register custom tools
- View findings with evidence
- Scan history with diffs

### Multi-Format Output
- **Terminal:** Colorized, prioritized findings
- **JSON:** Machine-readable export
- **Markdown:** Bounty-ready report
- **HTML:** Standalone dark-theme report
- **CSV:** Spreadsheet import
- **SQLite:** Full history for diffing
- **Notifications:** Webhook/Slack/Discord on scan completion

## CLI Commands

```bash
gungnir hunt <target> [--scope brief.txt] [--pipeline name] [--json out.json] [--report out.md]
gungnir tools list
gungnir tools install <name>
gungnir tools add <name> --binary /path/to/script
gungnir pipelines list
gungnir pipelines show <name>
gungnir scope --brief brief.txt --target example.com
gungnir history <target>
gungnir auth setup
gungnir serve [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 8888]
```

Default serve bind is **127.0.0.1**. Use `--host 0.0.0.0` only as an explicit opt-in when you intentionally expose the UI on all interfaces.


## Target Types
